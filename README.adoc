deadtree – Book management API
==============================
Lukas Epple <post@lukasepple.de>

deadtree is intended for managing the books in the hackerspace Openlab Augsburg. Currently this is done using librarything which should be replaced.

The project is in planning/design phase.

== Name
Needs a better™ name.

== Needed Features
Needs feedback from gamambel.

* Simple addition of books
* Advanced querying of books by users
* Owner management
* lending management

== Is deadtree obsolete?
https://github.com/openlab-aux/lsmsd[lsmsd] implements storage management. It should be considered if it is generic enough to be used to manage the library, too. This could be done by storing additional information in a item field using a specially crafted client.

== API draft

=== Authentification
Standard HTTP Authentification.

=== JSON objects

=== Ideas
* add URL fields to `author` and `publisher`

=== TODO
* Storage of ISBN
* Lending management
* Specification of the endpoints
** Authentification

== Storage
Since glaxx experience with https://www.mongodb.org/[mongodb] while programming https://github.com/openlab-aux/lsmsd[lsmsd] has been good the current idea is to use mongodb as storage.

== API programming
My Idea is to use Haskell and the framework https://haskell-servant.github.io[servant].
